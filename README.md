# JavaMathLib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ukonline/JavaMathLib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ukonline/JavaMathLib) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/javamathlib/badge/?version=latest)](http://javamathlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

JavaMathLib is a Java library with algorithms to solve mathematical problems, to
be used for pedagogical purposes. The library proposes among other support to
make computations with functions (evaluate, derive, integrate...), to use
matrices and perform basic linear algebra computations, etc. This documentation
is about the library itself: it presents its global architecture and delves into
the structure of the main classes. Additional material on activities and
projects that can be done with this library are proposed on the
http://www.ukonline.be website.
